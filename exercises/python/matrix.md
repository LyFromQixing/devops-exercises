# Matrix

Write a program that accepts N and M, then reads a matrix A of size NÃ—M, and writes down how many positive numbers are in the matrix along with the contents of the matrix itself.

# Example:

  ## Input:
  
 Insert N: 2
 
 Insert M: 4
 
 Insert the Value of A[1][1]: 1
 
 Insert the Value of A[1][2]: -3
 
 Insert the Value of A[1][3]: -9
 
 Insert the Value of A[1][4]: 0
 
 Insert the Value of A[2][1]: 1
 
 Insert the Value of A[2][2]: 0
 
 Insert the Value of A[2][3]: -2
 
 Insert the Value of A[2][4]: 3
 
  ## Output:
  
 There are three positive numbers in matrix A
 
 1 -3 -9 0
 
 1 0 -2 3
