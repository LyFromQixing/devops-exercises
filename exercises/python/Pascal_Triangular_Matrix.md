# Pascal's Triangular Matrix

Pascal's triangle can be created using matrices. The matrix is initially initialized with all values of the first row being 1 and all values of the first column being equal to 1. Then, each unfilled matrix is filled with the sum of the numbers above and to its left.

Write a program that takes N inputs and writes a Pascal's triangular matrix of size NÃ—N.

# Example:

## Input:

Insert N: 4

## Output:

1 1 1 1

1 2 3 4

1 3 6 10

1 4 10 20
